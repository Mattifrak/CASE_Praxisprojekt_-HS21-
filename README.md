# Cryptocurrency Price Trend Prediction using Machine Learning - CASE

For our CASE, we did a study about how to apply machine learning on diffrent datasets from Cryptocurrencies to see if it would be possible to predict the price trend of these diffrent coins. The coins we analysed are:

- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Chainlink
- Litecoin
- Dogecoin

We used the recurrent neural network architecture Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to try to predict the future price trends of these coins.

This project was supervised by Prof. Dr. Eduard Klein.
