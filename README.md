# Cryptocurrency Price Trend Prediction using Machine Learning - CASE


# Description project
For our CASE, we did a study about how to apply machine learning on diffrent datasets from Cryptocurrencies to see if it would be possible to predict the price trend of these diffrent coins. The coins we analysed are:

- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Chainlink
- Litecoin
- Dogecoin

# Cryptocurrencies


# Machine Learning

Our focus for this project was more in the deep learning part of Machine learning. We used the recurrent neural network architecture Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to try to predict the future price trends of these coins. This Recurrent Neural Network architecture is one of the most suitable architecture for predicting Stock/Crypto prices.

This project was supervised by Prof. Dr. Eduard Klein.
