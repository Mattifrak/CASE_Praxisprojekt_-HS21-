# Cryptocurrency Price Trend Prediction using Machine Learning - CASE


# Description project
For our CASE, we did a study about how to apply machine learning on diffrent datasets from Cryptocurrencies to see if it would be possible to predict the price trend of these diffrent coins. The coins we analysed are:

- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Chainlink
- Litecoin
- Dogecoin

# Dataset

A part of the data we used, we found on https://www.kaggle.com/odins0n/top-50-cryptocurrency-historical-prices. The other data was retrieved it from Coinbase PRO API. 

# Cryptocurrencies

As already said, we will try and predict the price tend of 5 crypto-coins. These coins were chosen by us. Because they are gaining more and more intrest by investors, it seemed us intresting to try and predict their price, instead of the regular stock market.

# Machine Learning

Our focus for this project was more in the deep learning part of Machine learning. We used the recurrent neural network architecture Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to try to predict the future price trends of these coins. This Recurrent Neural Network architecture is one of the most suitable architecture for predicting Stock/Crypto prices.


# Project context

This work has been conducted in a student project at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BUAS) in the bachelor study program "Link: [Business Information Technology] (https://www.bfh.ch/en/studies/bachelor/business-information-technology/)" (supervisor Eduard Klein).
